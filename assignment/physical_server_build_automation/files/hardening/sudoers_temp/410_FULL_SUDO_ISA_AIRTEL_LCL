# Begin  NA System Admin Ver 1.0   Date 2015-05-29  
# Description
# Software products and versions
# Supported OS platforms : All Unix/Linux variants.
# This sudo profile is the 'typical' system admin sudo entry
# where secondary logging is in use.  This entry is only to
# be used where secondary logging 'like' the methods
# documented on: https://ibm.biz/NAsudo2log
# are in use.  Implementing team is responsible to ensure 
# logging methodology works in their environment.  If secondary 
# logging is not in use, then the SA team must request an
# 'account-level'override exception.
#
# Self serve access considerations are 'Not applicable' for this template
#
#
# Use of this IBM approved standard template must follow NA 
# Sudo deployment requirements.
# Local adjustments, excepting the Host_Alias (For any needed
# segregation of hosts)  and User_Alias (to identify the local
# group name in use) for specific customer environments
# must be approved by 'Sudo Deployment AG/Hartford/IBM'
# 
#
# Version control
# V1.0 - highc@us.ibm.com - new template
# V1.1 - highc - add IBM_SA_AIXSMIT materials to allow for system
# 		system admins to use smit with appropriate logging.
# V1.2 - highc - based on v7.1 of standard aliases https://ibm.biz/GsudoStdAlias
#               being released,remove 'EXEC: smit' type lines.
#               Be certain to include the SMIT_SHELL=n materials from
#               v7.1 of the standard aliases on AIX systems. 
# V1.2.1 - highc- fix syntax/line continuation error. 
# V1.2.2 - highc- adjust user alias to better conform to global standard.
# 

# User Aliases
#
# Replace sample group names with real group names for your account.

# The User_Alias name IBM_SA to identify the Alias as the
# System Admin alias for IBM owned ID's.
#

User_Alias     IBM_SA_FULL = unmgr007,cyadmdu,arcos_root,balipat1,balipat2
	       # replace %unixinfr with the
               # -group- that contains the account specific IBM
               # System Administrator team personal or GIAMA ID's. 
               # DO NOT use this group for customer owned ID's.
               # Note:  It is permissible to comment out this line
               # and place IBM_SA_BAU directly into the sudoers file
               # to reference the local group.  This may save
               # effort in the future.

# Host Aliases

#Host_Alias    IBM_SA_HOSTS = ALL # In this template, we assume all
              # systems are managed by the IBM SA team.
              # Indicate a subset of systems if not all will be
              # managed by the same IBM team.

# Disallowed editors, this should ONLY be used as part of a negation, eg:  !IBM_NONE_EDITOR
# Special note regarding !IBM_NONE_EDITOR.  On RH V4 and older, 
# it is permissible to allow these editors via a NOEXEC as V4
# does not support sudoedit.  Best practice is to use a host
# alias to 'segregate' the older RH platforms.
